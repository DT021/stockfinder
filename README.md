## Stock Finder App

This app lets you search for stocks by ticker name and, if logged in, save to your watchlist.

The project utilizes Firebase for authentication, hosting, and database.

## API

Stock data is gathered from https://finnhub.io/ API

## Future Improvements

- Search by name, not just ticker
- Pull data from other endpoints

- Graph data
